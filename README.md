## Project Descripton:  
A first-player 2-D platform game using Phaser 3 and Node.js.  Dream takes you through a short story game-play of a young boy's dream.  You will experience cut scenes and two different implementations of game-play as you are challenged to pass the levels in order to experience the entire dream.  This is the collaboration and integration of different scenes created by Hiro and Brad.  We hope you like it, have fun.  Feel free to clone and make it your own, or implement your own code to make it better.  Thank you!
